I'm an economist and a full-stack data scientist.

I have worked on exciting data science projects both in the private and public sectors. I have conducted an analysis covering apprenticeship data within the Department of Education in the UK. I have investigated the impact of apprenticeship on income. I have determined which characteristics are important for determining the expected salary 3 years after finishing the apprenticeship. I have gained experience in many techniques ranging from data cleaning, dimensionality reduction to building machine learning models, comparing and interpreting them. Private sector projects cover discovering which users are likely to become disengaged with the content and suggesting the next best action which will likely increase the engagement of customers.

My education is directly linked to data science. I have earned distinction in statistics in a top 20 world statistics department (according to Shanghai rankings) at the University of Warwick. I have also obtained First Class degree in Economics and Econometrics from the University of Nottingham. Merging these two disciplines allows me to provide insightful economic analysis using powerful statistical tools.
