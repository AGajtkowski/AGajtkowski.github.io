I'm a data scientist within the Financial Times who excels at data cleaning, EDA, and statistical analysis. I am interested in research of customers behaviour based on big data. In particular I am fascinated by the ability to compute expected value of custoners. I am also specialised in time-series analysis, big-data nowcasting and various machine learning applications.

I have worked on exciting data science projects both in a private and public sectors. I have conducted analysis covering apprenticeship data within the Department of Education in the UK. I have investigated the impact of apprenticeship on income. I have determined which characteristics are important for determining expected salary 3 years after finishing the apprenticeship. I have gained experience in many techniques ranging from data cleaning, dimensionality reduction to building machine learning models, comparing and interpreting them. Private sector projects covers discovering which users are likely to become disengage with the content and suggesting next best action which will likely increase the engagement of customers.

My education is directly linked to the data science. I have earned distinction in statistics in a top 20 world statistics department (according to Shangkai rankings) at the University of Warwick. I have also obtained First Class degree in Economics and Econometrics from the University of Nottingam. Mergning these two disciplines allow me to provide insightful economic analysis using powerful statistical tools.
