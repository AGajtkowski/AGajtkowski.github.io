Abstract

This project investigates the employment outcomes of apprenticeship starters. In particular, we focus on analysing the role of background characteristics of learners on their employment outcomes. For the purpose of the analysis we derive 4 data sets of apprenticeship starters in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. We investigate the relationship between variables by conducting exploratory data analysis and running supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. We find that characteristics related to prior employment have strong impact on employment outcomes. We note that gender, region, and ethnicity also have a strong impact on employment outcomes. We find that background characteristics of learners have limited predictive power for hav- ing both positive and negative employment outcomes. We find that among all tested statistical model, deep neural network performs best in terms of predictive power and different measures of errors. We conclude that back- ground characteristics of individuals to some extent can predict employment outcomes, but they are not sufficient for creating accurate forecasts.
